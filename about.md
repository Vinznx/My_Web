Projects {#projects .unnumbered .unnumbered}
========

**Traffic landmark detection for high-definition map creation**

-   Developed a convolutional-neural-network-based model that detects
    and localizes traffic landmarks in the 3D space based on real-time
    camera and LiDAR data. Those traffic landmarks include traffic
    signs, traffic lights, and landmarks.

-   Developed a mapping system that effectively stitches representative
    LiDAR points across time according to the detected traffic
    landmarks.

-   Such a mapping system is lightweight and storage-friendly.

**Multisensor-based object detection for autonomous driving**

-   Developed a deep model for 2D instance segmentation based on DeepLab
    V3+.

-   Developed a deep model for 2D object detection based on MaskRCNN and
    Yolo v3.

-   Developed a deep model for 3D object detection based on PointNet++.

-   Developed a fusion model that aggregates information from both
    camera and LiDAR.

-   Deployed the models in the formation of PB files for the real-world
    system.

**Fast laser spot center detection**

-   Developed a Python script to monitor the experiment process
    including control stage movement and record data.

-   Generated 40,000 labeled data by applying the least squares method.

-   Trained a CNN model to find the center of the observed spot.

-   Speed up the measuring process by 3 times and increase the accuracy
    for irregular observations.
